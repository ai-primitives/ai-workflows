# Summarize Ticket

This MDX file defines the behavior for the `ai.summarize()` method. When called, it will:
1. Take a ticket object as input
2. Use the system prompt and model defined above
3. Generate a structured summary using the specified output schema

## Usage Example

```typescript
const summary = await ai.summarize(ticket)
// Returns an object matching the output schema type
```

## Implementation Notes

The output will be validated against a Zod schema generated from the frontmatter output definition. The `type` field supports enum values (separated by |) which will be converted to a Zod enum schema.
